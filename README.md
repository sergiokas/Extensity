## Extensity

### Quickly enable/disable Google Chrome extensions

get rid of it for a little while. You can also launch Chrome Apps right from the list.

* Keep your browser fast - disable extensions that you won't use right away.
* Keep your toolbar clean
* Ideal companion for extensions collectors.
